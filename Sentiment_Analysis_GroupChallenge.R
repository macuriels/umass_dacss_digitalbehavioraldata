## This is a group challenge. Use the tutorial (https://weiaiwayne.github.io/teaching_dacss/sentiment_analysis_practice.html#step-2-clean-timestamps) for demo codes 

## Task 1: all XXX parts in the code below need to be edited/replaced to make the code work for the new data
## Task 2: If you see ## (PLEASE ANNOTATE THIS CODE) after a line of code, please write a comment there explaining what the line of code does
## Task 3: Produce a highcharter plot (line ) showing different sentiments over time by three distinct cities. Save a screenshot for submission
## Task 4: Produce a ggplot2 plot showing top sentiment words by sentiment types (line ). Screen capture it for submission
